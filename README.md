# DevOps for Blockchain using Jenkins

This project is inspired by the work of [Redback and Microsoft teams for developing the process for DevOps using VSTS](https://microsoft.github.io/techcasestudies/redback-devops.html).

I've chosen to develop a similar DevOps process using Jenkins, Truffle and TestRPC so that we can give choices for our customers.

The project contains the components needed to build the build and test pipeline.

More to come ...
